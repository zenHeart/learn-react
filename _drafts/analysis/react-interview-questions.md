# React Internals Interview Questions Bank

## üéØ 50+ Questions to Master React Interviews

**Organized by difficulty and topic to ensure complete coverage of React internals knowledge**

## üåü Fundamentals (Entry-Level)

### Q1: What happens when you call ReactDOM.createRoot()?
**Answer**: 
- Creates a `FiberRootNode` with tag `ConcurrentRoot`
- Creates a `HostRoot` fiber as the root of the fiber tree
- Initializes update queue on the HostRoot fiber
- Returns a `ReactDOMRoot` wrapper object with `render()` method
- Marks the DOM container as a React root

**Source**: `packages/react-dom/src/client/ReactDOMClient.js#L92`

### Q2: What's the difference between React elements and Fiber nodes?
**Answer**:
- **React Element**: Plain object `{type, key, props, _owner, _store}` - immutable description
- **Fiber Node**: Mutable object with work state, child/sibling pointers, effect flags
- Elements describe what you want, Fibers track the work to make it happen
- One element can create multiple fibers (current + work-in-progress)

### Q3: Explain React's two-phase rendering
**Answer**:
- **Render Phase**: Interruptible, builds fiber tree, calls components, runs hooks
- **Commit Phase**: Synchronous, applies DOM changes, runs effects
- Render phase can be paused/restarted, commit phase must complete atomically
- This enables time-slicing and concurrent features

### Q4: How does React handle event delegation?
**Answer**:
- Single event listener on document root for all events
- Events bubble up to React's listener
- React creates `SyntheticEvent` wrapper for cross-browser compatibility
- Event handlers found via fiber tree traversal
- Enables features like event pooling and consistent behavior

### Q5: What are React's priority lanes in React 19?
**Answer**:
- Bitwise priority system replacing expiration times
- `SyncLane` (1) = highest priority (user input)
- `DefaultLane` = normal updates
- `TransitionLane` = non-urgent updates
- `IdleLane` = lowest priority background work
- Enables better scheduling and interruption

## üî• Intermediate (Mid-Level)

### Q6: Walk through the complete useState execution flow
**Answer**:
```javascript
// Mount phase:
1. mountState() creates hook object with memoizedState
2. Hook added to fiber.memoizedState linked list
3. Returns [initialState, dispatchSetState]

// Update phase:
1. dispatchSetState() creates update object
2. enqueueUpdate() adds to hook's update queue
3. scheduleUpdateOnFiber() schedules re-render
4. updateState() processes update queue during re-render
5. Returns [newState, dispatchSetState]
```

### Q7: How does React's reconciliation algorithm work?
**Answer**:
- **Single elements**: Compare type and key, reuse if same
- **Arrays**: Use keys to match old/new elements efficiently
- **Different types**: Unmount old tree, mount new tree
- **Same type**: Update props and continue with children
- **Key heuristic**: Elements with same key assumed to be same component

### Q8: Explain React's double buffering technique
**Answer**:
- Two fiber trees: `current` (on screen) and `workInProgress` (being built)
- During render, work on workInProgress tree
- After commit, swap pointers: workInProgress becomes current
- Enables atomic updates and rollback capability
- `fiber.alternate` points between the two trees

### Q9: How do React hooks maintain state between renders?
**Answer**:
- Hooks stored as linked list on `fiber.memoizedState`
- Hook order must stay consistent (why no hooks in conditionals)
- Each hook has `memoizedState`, `next` pointer, and update queue
- Different dispatcher used for mount vs update phases
- Hook state persists on fiber between renders

### Q10: What happens during React's commit phase?
**Answer**:
```javascript
// Three sub-phases:
1. Before Mutation:
   - getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
   - Schedule useEffect callbacks

2. Mutation:
   - DOM operations (appendChild, removeChild)
   - Update DOM properties
   - Set refs to null for deletions

3. Layout:
   - componentDidMount/Update
   - useLayoutEffect callbacks
   - Update refs with new values
```

## üöÄ Advanced (Senior-Level)

### Q11: How does React's scheduler implement time-slicing?
**Answer**:
- Uses `MessageChannel` for scheduling (or `setTimeout` fallback)
- Yields control every 5ms by default
- Checks `shouldYield()` between units of work
- Higher priority work can interrupt lower priority
- Implements cooperative multitasking without blocking main thread

### Q12: Explain React's lane-based priority system
**Answer**:
- 31-bit bitmask system for fine-grained priorities
- Multiple lanes can be batched together
- Lane entanglement for related updates
- `getHighestPriorityLane()` selects work to do next
- Enables sophisticated scheduling strategies

### Q13: How does React handle error boundaries internally?
**Answer**:
- `throwException()` catches errors during render
- Traverses fiber tree upward looking for error boundary
- Calls `getDerivedStateFromError()` and `componentDidCatch()`
- Creates error recovery fiber to re-render with error state
- Unwinds work stack and restarts from error boundary

### Q14: What's the difference between useEffect and useLayoutEffect?
**Answer**:
```javascript
// useLayoutEffect:
- Runs synchronously after DOM mutations
- Blocks browser paint
- Use for DOM measurements/synchronous updates

// useEffect:
- Runs asynchronously after paint
- Doesn't block browser paint
- Use for side effects that don't affect layout
```

### Q15: How does React implement concurrent features?
**Answer**:
- Work split into interruptible units
- Scheduler yields to browser between units
- High-priority updates interrupt low-priority work
- Uses `startTransition()` for non-urgent updates
- Enables responsive UI during heavy computation

## üéØ Expert (Staff/Principal-Level)

### Q16: How would you implement your own React?
**Answer**:
```javascript
// Mini-React implementation:
1. createElement() - create element objects
2. render() - reconcile elements to DOM
3. useState() - state management with re-render
4. Basic reconciler with diff algorithm
5. Component lifecycle management
6. Event handling system
```

### Q17: How does React's context system work internally?
**Answer**:
- Context providers create context values on fiber nodes
- Consumers traverse up fiber tree to find nearest provider
- `readContext()` during render subscribes component to context
- Context changes trigger re-render of all consumers
- Uses stack-like structure for nested providers

### Q18: Explain React's effect scheduling system
**Answer**:
- Effects stored in circular linked list on fiber
- Different effect tags for different types (Layout, Passive, etc.)
- Passive effects scheduled with scheduler for async execution
- Layout effects run synchronously after DOM mutations
- Effect cleanup runs before next effect or unmount

### Q19: How does React handle component updates efficiently?
**Answer**:
- `React.memo()` prevents re-render if props unchanged
- `useMemo()`/`useCallback()` memoize expensive computations
- Fiber tree reuse via `bailoutOnAlreadyFinishedWork()`
- Lane-based batching reduces redundant work
- Early bailout when state doesn't change

### Q20: What are React's internal debugging hooks?
**Answer**:
- `__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__` for DevTools integration
- `onScheduleUpdate`, `onCommitRoot` callbacks
- Fiber tree inspection via DevTools
- Performance profiling with React DevTools Profiler
- Error boundary tracking and component stack traces

## üî¨ Deep Internals (Expert+)

### Q21: How does React's work loop handle interruptions?
**Answer**:
```javascript
function workLoopConcurrent() {
  while (workInProgress !== null && !shouldYield()) {
    performUnitOfWork(workInProgress);
  }
}

// shouldYield() checks:
- Time elapsed since start
- Pending higher priority work
- Browser needs to paint/handle events
```

### Q22: Explain React's update batching mechanism
**Answer**:
- Updates batched by priority lane
- `flushSync()` forces immediate synchronous update
- Automatic batching in React 18+ for all updates
- `unstable_batchedUpdates()` for manual batching
- Event handlers automatically batched

### Q23: How does React implement Suspense?
**Answer**:
- Component throws promise during render
- `throwException()` catches and handles promise
- Suspense boundary catches thrown promise
- Shows fallback UI while promise pending
- Re-renders when promise resolves

### Q24: What's React's approach to memory management?
**Answer**:
- Fiber nodes reused across renders
- Object pooling for frequently created objects
